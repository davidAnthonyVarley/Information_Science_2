ok, so the longer i set the timeout, the worse it performed, couunter-intuitively


with amplify version 1.3.1, I was able to implement the QUBO constraints.
all of my constraints bar one worked consistently, the all_different(..) constraint

I attempted 

Time elasped for amplify pure for n = 2:
10.379272222518921 seconds

Time elasped for amplify pure for n = 3:
11.539141416549683 seconds

Time elasped for amplify pure for n = 4:
10.133787631988525 seconds

Time elasped for amplify pure for n = 5:
350 seconds

Time elasped for amplify pure for n = 6:
2m 48s to load constraints
